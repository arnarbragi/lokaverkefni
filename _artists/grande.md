Ariana Grande-Butera is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. As one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for her wide vocal range and has received various accolades, including one Grammy Award, one Brit Award, two Billboard Music Awards, and three American Music Awards.

Born in Florida, Grande began her career in 2008 in the Broadway musical, 13. She rose to prominence for her role as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series, Victorious (2010–2013) and in its spin-off, Sam & Cat (2013–2014). As she grew interested in pursuing a music career, Grande recorded songs for the soundtrack of Victorious and signed with Republic Records in 2011 after the label's executives discovered videos of her covering songs that she uploaded onto YouTube. She released her debut album, Yours Truly, in 2013. A 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B album, it peaked atop the US Billboard 200 and spawned her first US top-ten single, "The Way", featuring rapper Mac Miller.
